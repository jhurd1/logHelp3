    On this, the fourth or fifth try at this application in three weeks, I have seen the following error in React
    more than once:

        Compiled with problems:X

        ERROR in ../../../node_modules/axios/lib/adapters/xhr.js 17:10-24

        Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'url' in '/Users/jamiehurd/node_modules/axios/lib/adapters'

        BREAKING CHANGE: webpack < 5 used to include polyfills for node.js core modules by default.
        This is no longer the case. Verify if you need this module and configure a polyfill for it.

        If you want to include a polyfill, you need to:
            - add a fallback 'resolve.fallback: { "url": require.resolve("url/") }'
            - install 'url'
        If you don't want to include a polyfill, you can use an empty module like this:
            resolve.fallback: { "url": false }

2. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46239109/axios-version-package-json
    To upgrade to a specific version of Axios:
    npm install <package>@<version> --save
    The --save option embeds the text in the package.json file.

3. Uncaught TypeError: react__WEBPACK_IMPORTED_MODULE_0___default(...).render is not a function
       at Module../src/index.js
        https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61388663/typeerror-react-webpack-imported-module-0-default-is-not-a-function
        I needed to amend my import statement in index.js to include {} braces around an object:
        import {serviceUser} from "./ServiceUser";

        This error returned. render() is deprecated as it was called in my context in index.js. I resolved it with a
        const variable that called createRoot.

4. Line returns a "promise."
    index.js: ServiceUser.getUser().

5. Apple concealed hidden folders despite the use of hotkeys.
    I needed to remove and reinstitute git to associate with a new repo but it was associating instead with the old ne.

    Use the following lines:
    defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE

    killall Finder

    ...

    Note: On apple ls -al shows the hidden folders in terminal.
